## My humble portfolio

A showcase of projects I've been happily a part of using the skills I've learned. Using `Scss` and `Gatsby` to develop easier and quicker, but most of all when I add my future posts it'll be a lot easier to extend. 

One day this will also contain posts documentating the technologies I find fascinating.
